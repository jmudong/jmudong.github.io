This project for HackDavis 2025, in collaboration with the wonderful Allison Peng and Samuel Li, was focused on quickly directing victims of natural disasters to nearby relief resources.
Locations that offer relief resources can range anywhere from local food banks to homeless shelters, as well as access to menstral products. 

This project took more of a software development focus, where we collected data from multiple sources - including data.ca.gov and the Google Maps API - and displayed them into a mobile app.
Data ingestion and processing was done through the Llama 4 model, which was provided to us from Cerebras (although we ran out of credits by the end of the hackathon, so our end result just started
hallucinating).
