Hello! My name is Jasper Dong, and I am currently pursuing a M.S. in Statistics at the University of Washington, Seattle. I previously earned my B.S. in Statistics at the University of California, Davis, with a minor in Geographic Information Systems. 

My interests lie mostly in data analytics and data science applications to the social sciences and environmental fields. Recently, I've been more interested in ML/AI modeling, specifically in ML/AI safety and validation. My undergraduate research with Maike Sonnewald was focused on applying concepts from traditional hypothesis testing to high-dimensional clustering algorithms, with applications to physical oceanogrpahy data. 

__I am currently searching for internships for Summer 2026, specifically in analytics, data science, or ML/AI engineering. Please let me know if you hear of any opportunities!__
