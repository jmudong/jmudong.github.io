      <h2>Jasper Dong</h2>
      <p>
        I am currently a graduate student in the M.S. Statistics program at the
        University of Washington, Seattle.
      </p>
      <p>
        I hold a B.S. degree in Statistics from the University of California, Davis, with a 
        minor in Geographic Information Systems.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am broadly interested in data analytics and machine learning, 
        with applicaitons in spatial and environmental statistics. However, I am also
        open to exploring other areas of research, such as database engineering, causal modeling,
        and hypothesis testing. Conveniently, staying in academia lets me explore all of
        my potential research interests.

        My undergraduate research, advised by 
        <a href="https://msonnewald.com/" target="_blank">Maike Sonnewald</a> as a part of the
        <a href="https://compclimate.github.io/ccog.github.io/" target="_blank">Computational Climate and Ocean Group</a>,
        is focused on developing statistical validation methods for clusterings of
        complex and nonlinear data.

        This website is currently under heavy revision until I learn how to make this look nicer (which could be a while!).
        For now, this really just serves as a central hub for all my relevant information.
