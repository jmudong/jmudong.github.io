      Hi, my name is Jasper Dong and I am a third year Statistics major at UC Davis!
      I am broadly interested in environmental and social applications of data science through statistical and machine learning methods,
      with experience in R, Python, SQL, and MATLAB. Some topics I am passionate about are policy analysis, urban planning, and remote
      sensing. My hobbies include volleyball, amateur photography, and traveling!
